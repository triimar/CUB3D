### Overview

CUB3D is a project strongly inspired by Wolfenstein 3D game. Raycasting is used to create a walled space where the "palyer" can move around.

This CUB3D uses [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42) graphics library version 2.2.1.
It has been created in cooperation with [Christina Repou](https://github.com/ChrRepou)

<br>

### Bonus

Bonus version of the program implements a minimap in the left upper corner of the window and includes doors that can be opened and closed. Movement is smoother because wall collisions are avoided and viewpoint can be changed with the use of the mouse.

<br>

### Actions 

- `left` and `right` arrow keys allow the player to look left and right
- `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys move the player forward, left, right and backward within the maze.
- Pressing `ESC` or clicking the `X` on the window closes the window and quits the program.

Added to the bonus:

- `SPACE` bar opens and closes the doors.
- `MOUSE` movement within the window allows to rotate the point of view.
